   An Informational Interview with the members of the Video Team
  </span>
 </h2>
 <h5 id="toc1">
  <span>
   What is the video team's purpose/mission?
  </span>
 </h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Purpose: To capture the varying realities of transfer experiences at UC Berkeley through film in order to create a visual guide for incoming and continuing transfer students.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mission: Our mission is to create a series of videos that cater to transfer students and their experiences at UC Berkeley.
  </li>
 </ul>

   Can you tell me a bit more about your equipment and how you use it?
  </span>
 </h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Camera (Kind): The camera is used to capture the raw footage, which we later edit.
  </li>
  <li>
   Macbook Pro: This is where all of the editing is done.
  </li>
  <li>
   Terabyte: The memory block holds all of our raw footage, completed video, and any other material for the Transfer Student Center.
  </li>
  <li>
   Mic: The small mic allows us to capture a clearer voice, as it drowns out the background noises. It's small enough to be hidden on the collar of the folks being interviewed.
  </li>
  <li>
   Shoulder Strap: The shoulder strap allows us to capture more stable shots. It also gives the crew better control of the footage.
  </li>
  <li>
   Lights: Our lights are used to light the faces in closed settings during interviews.
  </li>
  <li>
   Stand: The stand is used to keep the camera standing still during an interview.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h5 id="toc3">
  <span>
   Where do you post your videos?
  </span>
 </h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Facebook: Given that Facebook allows us to reach our specific audiences, and makes content easier to share, our primary avenue is on that platform.
  </li>
  <li>
   Youtube: Because YouTube makes the link easier to share for folks without Facebook, that is the second avenue to utilize to post our videos. It also makes it possible to post them on our website.
  </li>
  <li>
   Website: We post videos on our website from YouTube, all organized under the Transfer Vision tab.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h5 id="toc4">
  <span>
   How do you videos help the transfer population?
  </span>
 </h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Our videos aim to provide students with a multimedia platform where they can foster critical information about the transfer center, inspiring transfer students, and helpful tips about transitioning to Cal.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h5 id="toc5">
  <span>
   How do you work together as a team?
  </span>

 <ul>
  <li>
   Currently, the video team is set up into two divisions: Transfer Spotlight and Transfer Vision. Juan Prieto and Alphonse Simon are the lead producers of Transfer Spotlight and Transfer Vision is spearheaded by Miles Aiello. Juan can be reached at

  <span>
   What is your approach to making videos?
  </span>
 </h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   We sit down first and talk about what our goals are for the video. After some shared discourse, we then come to a conclusion about how we want to proceed. We take that information and relay it to our supervisors to get approval, and then move forward witht he production process.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h5 id="toc7">
  <span>
   Do you get grant funding? If so, how?
  </span>
 </h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Yes, we received a technology grant which allowed us to purchase all the technology currently in use.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h5 id="toc8">
  <span>
   Any tips for a future video team?
  </span>
 </h5>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Ensure that displaying the diversity of our transfer community is at the core of your videos.
  </li>
  <li>
   Thoroughly plan out a day-to-day schedule of what creating a specific video is going to require, and stick to that schedule.
  </li>
  <li>
   Produce quality and represent the Transfer community with Pride.
  </li>
 </ul>
