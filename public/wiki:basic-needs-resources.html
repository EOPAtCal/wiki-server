   Information on the Food Assistance Program
  </a>
  <br/>
  The Food Assistance Program is available in the Fall and Spring to currently enrolled students. Financial aid will look to see if students have exhausted all of their financial options, including utilizing all loans. If a student is unable to utilize loans provided and wants to apply for the Food Assistance Program, they should still apply and be available to share the reason they can not exhaust that option.
 </p>
 <p>
  Students will need to submit the
  <a href="http://financialaid.berkeley.edu/forms" target="_blank">
   Food Assistance
  </a>
  form and meet one-on-one with a Financial Aid Advisor.

     HOUSING SECURITY
    </strong>
   </tt>
  </span>
 </h1>
 <p>
  Students who do not have safe or secure housing are able to get in contact with the Basic Needs Coordinator, Ruben Canedo, to get housing security options. It is important to highlight that this is a process for students who are housing insecure and is not an option of convenience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Funds breakdown:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    Financial Aid
   </strong>
   is always in the conversation, given the funding aspect that can negatively impact students in the long run. (Exception are made in time sensitive and crisis situations)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Emergency Housing Fund
   </strong>
   is a CACSSF Grant awarded to the Student Advocates Office. The lead is the Student Advocate (Jillian for 2017-2018). The funds are housed in Financial Aid for direct awarding purposes. Total grant was $55,000, about 90% of the grant money is still available.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    The Basic Needs Crisis Fund
   </strong>
   , is triggered for time sensitive &amp; crisis situations. Example: we had a re-entry student, with a fractured foot, that disclosed was sleeping in a bushy area of campus. I picked them up and checked them into a hotel for a night. They moved into their Co-Op the next day. Funds vary depending on fundraising.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Process breakdown:
  <br/>
  These processes are being built out, learned from, and improved with each student we serve. As you know better than most, every student is unique.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Once student is identified, connect with the Basic Needs Coordinator (Ruben Canedo) and provide context about whats going on with that student.
  </li>
  <li>
   Basic Needs Coordinator then alerts Student Advocates Office + Financial Aid + RSSP.
  </li>
  <li>
   RSSP will mobilize to identify housing availability, if available, they confirm cost to us Student Advocates office green-lights
  </li>
  <li>
   Financial Aid strategizes best way to complete payment
  </li>
  <li>
   If on-campus housing is not available, we then have to turn to community partners for availability
   <ul>
    <li>
     Taylor Harvey, Homeless Student Union has a network
    </li>
    <li>
     Chuck Grant, Safe Time Hosts has a network
    </li>
    <li>
     Both of these are very limited
    </li>
    <li>
     Cost is dictated by host
    </li>
   </ul>
