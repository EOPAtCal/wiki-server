  Once students who have been admitted to Berkeley are offered their admission, the admissions office start to organize yield events. Their goal is to try to increase the number of students who accept Berkeleys offer. Essentially, we are trying to convince students why Berkeley is the best choice and option.
  <br/>
  The Transfer Student Center works in conjunction with the Admissions office and focuses completely on Transfer Students. We do Receptions for Transfers in four locations:

  This Yield is hosted on UC Berkeley's Campus and is divided up into three sections:

     This reception is held at CKC which is the Clark Kerr Campus. We focus this presentation towards first generation, low-income, and/or minority students and they are the students who are primarily invited. We create a program of speakers, performances, and presentations, including the Vice Chancellor of the University. Often, the presenters are students and staff from the CE3 unit.
     <br/>
     We typically try to host a raffle with Cal Gear, and also give out goodie bags to the attendees. Last year we also had a photo booth and props. Last year we hosted approximately 350 students. The Transfer Center Director (Lorena Valdez) chairs, hosts, and coordinates this Reception.

     This reception is held typically held at Zellerbach Hall and is open to all admitted prospective students. It is similar to the Vice Chancellors reception but is much larger. In 2015 we had approximately 1,200 students attend. The Program included a performance dance from Bollywood Dance Group on Campus, and short 2-4 minutes speeches from the Vice Chancellor (The Chancellor frequently declines the invitation), two current students, one alumni, and The Dean of Students. These speeches were encouraging students to attend Berkeley.

     The Resource Fair is held on Upper Sproul and consists of a whole host of campus partners setting up tables and booths. Most tables/booths have materials for students to take with them including fliers, candies, Cal Gear, informational packets, etc. The people who work the booth are well-versed in the resource they are presenting. The Transfer Center has a booth in which a number of students from the center, typically student employees, share their experiences, ask questions, and provide information to prospective students in attendence. We try to introduce the center and the program areas.

  We travel down to Southern California ("we" is a number of people from the Admissions Office, as well as a few people from each of the Programs in CE3). It is essentially a combonation of a Reception and a Resource Fair. We make presentations, have food available, and then we open up the booths to student questions. At the Transfer Center table, we have Staff and Student Staff available for questions. We share our persepectives, introduce the center and its program areas, as well as provide as much information as we can to the prospective student.
