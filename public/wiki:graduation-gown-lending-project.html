  Graduation can be a very exciting moment for many of our students, but for some, the cost of buying a graduation gown is another expense that impedes them from fully experiencing the culminating moment of their academic achievement. The Educational Opportunity Program has created the "Graduation Gown Lending Project" to support first generation and low income UC Berkeley students with free rental of graduation gowns. Conceived by EOP Peer Academic Counselors, this project was created to help alleviate some of the hardships of graduation expenses.

  , the Graduation Gown Lending Project launched in Spring 2013 just in time for year end ceremonies. Alumni and community sponsors also provided support that resulted in over 100 cap and gowns being lent to students. We welcome new or excellent condition cap and gowns that can be dropped off or shipped to:
