 <p>
  Every Tuesday a Financial Aid counselor hosts drop-in hours at EOP from 3 PM to 4 PM in 126 Cesar Chavez to meet with EOP students to discuss any questions or concerns they may have about their financial aid package. The designated EOP counselor needs to make sure that 126 Chavez is available every Tuesday for Financial Aid to have access to the space. The EOP counselor is also responsible for communicating with the staff if the Financial Aid Liaison will not be in the office.

   The Process

  Students will check-in at the front desk where this is a signup sheet. The drop-in counseling is based on a first-come first-serve basis.
