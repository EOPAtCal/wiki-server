   ADVISING AT THE TRANSFER STUDENT CENTER:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Transitioning to a 4-year research university from another college or university can be challenging. We understand that transfer students face academic, social, and personal adjustments as they make the transition to Cal. Given the short time to graduation (2 years), transfer students must quickly learn to navigate the university and its resources. Our staffpractices a holistic, multicultural, and solution-focused approach that helps you consider options and possibilities. Students receive support transitioning to the university, understanding the academic planning process, navigating resources and enrichment opportunities, understanding requirements, exploring career options, and preparing for life after Cal. We also assist students in managing the various extenuating circumstances that may impact their lives while ensuring progress towards graduation. As transfer students, you will benefit from our programs, services, and extensive campus referral network.
