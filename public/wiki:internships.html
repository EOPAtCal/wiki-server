     The Lead Peer Advocate
    </strong>
   </span>
  </span>
 </h3>
 <p>
  1. What are some qualities you think are important for a Lead Peer Advocate to have?
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   A Lead Peer Advocate should have experience, initiative, drive/passion, and presence. A lead peer advocate should be a peer advocate before transitioning into the lead role in order to gain the knowledge of the transfer resources, the transfer culture, and the job itself. While working as a peer advocate, the lead should show initiative in "bettering" the transfer student center, such as finding ways to improve transfer resources, provide better service for the students that enter the center, improving the transfer student space, etc. This initiative will also reflect on his/her passion and drive for the work done at the center. Like any good leader, the lead peer advocate should have good social/communication skills that will allow for him/her to be successful in guiding other peer advocates as well as the transfer students on campus. Lastly, his/her presence will allow for others to also be passionate for the mission of the transfer student center.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  2. What sets you apart from Peer Advocates?
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Lead Peer Advocate typically has shown a strong sense of leadership within the role. The lead shows a strong work ethic and organizational skills that allow for exemplary leadership on and off the job. The lead's initiative to improve the center allows for him/her to stand out from the rest of the peer advocates.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  3. What are your most important responsibilities and how do you handle them?
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The Lead Peer Advocate organizes and produces the weekly front desk schedule, while communicating with the peer advocates to fill in any and all empty shifts. The Lead Peer Advocate takes a leadership role in several events that require a Transfer representative. The lead also helps plan and facilitate the training sessions for the peer advocates and any other meetings with the transfer staff. The lead should be able to assist the peer advocates with any questions, concerns, or activities, as well as oversee the needs at the front desk.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  4. Is there anything in particular that you would like to share with a future Lead?
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   "Have patience with the different roles that you have to play while being a Lead. The job requires for you to get creative sometimes so don't be afraid of trying new methods to achieve your duties as a Lead. Never feel like you can't be unsure about something. Ask many questions! Keep learning and challenging yourself. Enjoy what you do and always let your passion flow with the work that you do at the center."
