   HOW DOES THE MAJOR INSIGHTS PROGRAM WORK?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  When a student indicates interest in meeting with a continuing transfer student in the same major we will match the student with a name from our majors database. We will then contact the mentor and ask them to contact the student by email. Together they will arrange for a time to meet. The mentor/mentee can choose to work together exclusively via e-mail exchanges if thats more convenient. Mentors are asked to meet at least once or twice with mentees. We will begin matching students with mentors starting in the first week of the semester.
  <br/>
  This program operates as an avenue for new transfer students to get access to information at Cal that would have otherwise been obscured until experienced. It offers insights (hence the name) into what to expect, campus culture, things to do, ways to manage, and so on. This can all be incredibly valuable for a new student who is feeling overwhelmed. It also makes sure they have at least one connection on campus, someone they can refer to, and rely on to help them capitalize on their experience here.

  This program connects community college students with UC Berkeley transfer student mentors who offer guidance, motivation, and access to campus and community resources. The program is specifically designed to encourage students from backgrounds that are underserved and/or non-traditional in higher education (re-entry students, student parents, veteran students, low income, first generation college students, underrepresented students, disabled students, etc.) and encourages all students to explore their academic potential and prepare for transfer to UC Berkeley. Mentoring is completed by email, phone calls, campus visits, workshops, and the use of online technologies.
