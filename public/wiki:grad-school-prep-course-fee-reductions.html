  <strong>
   Eligibility
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Students must be Pell or Dream act eligible in order to receive the fee reduction. Student staff can use Quincy or call a counselor to verify the status. If student staff member cannot verify status and a counselor is not available, have the student fill out a form and submit it to the EOP director. In total, students should be filling out very few paper applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Officially, only current undergraduate students are eligible for the fee reduction. However, as an internal process, counselors may allow a six month grace period after graduation. Additionally, if a counselor identifies an urgent need for an alumni to receive a fee reduction, they may put the student on the Googledoc and ask the student not to share their alumni status with the agency representatives.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Once a students information has been inputted into the GoogleDoc, there is no deadline by which they need to sign up for the test-prep course. Once their eligibility is verified via MyFinaid or Quincy, staff can add the students information to the shared GoogleDoc. The next steps in the process are contingent upon the respective test-prep agency:

   Kaplan GoogleDoc
  </a>
  , staff then provides the student with a unique five character code listed on the Kaplan GoogleDoc next to their name. Student will use this code to receive the fee reduction when signing up for the test-prep course using this

  **Please note that once a students information has been inputted into the GoogleDoc, there is no deadline by which they need to sign up for the test-prep course. Officially, no student is eligible for the fee reduction once they graduate. However, as an internal process, if a counselor identifies a urgent need for an alumni to receive a fee reduction, they may put the student on the Googledoc and ask the student not to share their alumni status with the agency representatives.
