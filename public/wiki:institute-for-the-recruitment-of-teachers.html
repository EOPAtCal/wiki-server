   Institute for the Recruitment of Teachers (IRT)
  </a>
  is an educational organization established within The Philips Academy since 1990. IRT and EOP have a professional partnership to encourage EOP students apply to graduate school. IRTs mission is to diversify teaching faculties and institutions across the country by recruiting high achieving students of color who seek an advance degree to become teachers, professors, counselors, and education administrators in teaching facilities K-12 and universities and colleges across the U.S.A. IRT helps students apply to graduate school by helping them write their personal statement, pay for graduate school applications, and find the most supportive graduate programs that will provide the most funding. IRT works closely with a consortium of top universities across the country who are committed to recruit IRT students.

   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  IRT primarily supports first generation low income and underrepresented students. IRT will contact EOP over the phone in mid-December to select a day in mid-February to interview students during the day (9 AM  5 PM) and provide an informational interview in the early evening. This is an opportunity for prospective applicants to learn more about the program. While informational interviews are not a required part of the application process, they are highly encouraged for our EOP students.

  <br/>
  It is important to publicize IRT from the first day of classes to the day of the event. The EOP counselor will also secure a space for both the interviews during the day and the informational in the evening (such as 100 Chavez). Once the space and location is set in place, students can be informed of the event via

  , EOPatCal Instagram, and through our our campus allies. Students are encouraged to stop by the EOP office to chose a time frame to chat with Kate Slater on the day IRT visits the campus.
