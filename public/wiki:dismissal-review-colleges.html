  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  EOP does an "in-house" review of students who are subject to dismissal by an undergraduate college. The colleges (L&amp;S, CED, COE, COC, and CNR-only in the Spring) shares a list of EOP students that are Subject to Dismissal (STD) shortly after the end of Fall/Spring semesters. L&amp;S and COE are the only college divided amongst counselors and the lead counselor does the remaining colleges lists. Typically, Haas does not have any lists to share, but you can contact Dolann Adams or Barbara Felkins regarding the status of their list.
 </p>
 <p>
  Counselor heading College Partnerships initiative within the unit should remind advising directors to send lists and ask for colleges dismissal review timeline to then plan accordingly with EOP internal review timeline. Remind counselors this period is coming up and suggest blocking time on their schedules.
 </p>
 <p>
  These names are divided up and given to EOP Academic Counselors for review. Counselors review each students history of contact with EOP via Quincy. If it is a student we have seen, the counselor will also review their transcript and draft notes and a possible recommendation for course of action to be shared with their college. The counselors finalize notes and recommendations on a shared Google Doc. The coordinating counselor will proof the document and send to colleges. Counselors then input a note in Quincy. [Subject: 1.5 or 2.0 Dismissal; Note: Student reviewed for subject to dismissal. Notes shared with L&amp;S (or other college).] The college then takes this into consideration in determining whether to dismiss the student or continue on probation. There are no notes or recommendations offered for students that have not had contact with EOP.

  <strong>
   Lead Counselor Timeline
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Generally, the lists are generated 2 weeks after finals (about 1 week after grades are posted). Lead counselor should reach out to colleges to remind them about the dismissal review list by the beginning of RRR week in addition to asking for their deadline. It is important to ask colleges when their reviewal period is and to create an internal deadline 2 days before the colleges deadline. It is helpful to send a follow-up email the week after finals. Dismissal review lists are sent to the lead counselor after grades are posted. From there, it is a quick 2-3 day turnaround for counselors to complete recommendations. Lead counselor is also responsible for formatting the lists and briefly reviewing the document.

  <strong>
   Notes and Recommendations
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Notes should summarize the history of contact with EOP. It is important for the college to know whether or not the student is "plugged-in" to our unit as a support service. The college may require or recommend continued contact with EOP as part of the action plan for the student. Additionally, EOP Academic Counselors should point out any factors or issues that may have impacted the students ability to perform academically. It is also useful to emphasize if a student has made significant progress in a term although they did not officially clear probation. If there is sufficient EOP history/contact with a student, Academic Counselors may also offer a recommendation to continue. If there is not a significant history of contact or descriptive notes, no recommendation may be suggested.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once all Academic Counselors complete their review and notes, they are compiled by the EOP director in a single document that is then shared with the college. The entire process (obtaining list from college, completing reviews, compiling notes) typically happens very quickly with a 2-3 day turnaround time.

 <p>
  Note Format
  <br/>
  Notes are formatted starting with the student ID number and followed by Last, First name. Below this is the notes from the counselor. After the completed note, the recommendation. Examples below:
