     Starting Point Mentorship Program
    </a>
   </strong>
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  This program connects community college students with UC Berkeley transfer student mentors who offer guidance, motivation, and access to campus and community resources. The program is specifically designed to encourage students from backgrounds that are underserved and/or non-traditional in higher education (re-entry students, student parents, veteran students, low income, first generation college students, underrepresented students, disabled students, etc.) and encourages all students to explore their academic potential and prepare for transfer to UC Berkeley. Mentoring is completed by email, phone calls, campus visits, workshops, and the use of online technologies.

    Office of Undergraduate Admissions Drop-In Transfer Advising
   </strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  The Transfer Student Center in partnership with the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, provides a drop-in advising service for prospective transfer students every Thursday and Friday from 2:00-4:00pm. This advising session is meant to help students with their UC application and personal statement.
  <br/>
  This service is offered from August through November and is open to all community college students applying to Cal. Admissions advisors provide assistance and address questions regarding the transfer application process, course evaluation and articulation, requirements, selection criteria, and more. The summer months are less busy and as we move toward the application deadline, we will have a significant number of students attend. On occasion, we have had to turn students away. Students at the front desk assist with monitoring the number of students we can see. Admission will occasionally bring over 4-6 advisors to assist with the demand.
