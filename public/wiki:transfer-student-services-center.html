    MISSION:
   </strong>
  </span>
 </h2>
 <p>
  The center provides services to assist transfer students with navigating the academic and cultural landscape of the research university. We serve students who transfer to UC Berkeley from other institutions, those who are returning to their education after an interruption, and who are combining school with parenting. Our programs and services focus on supporting a successful transition, building connection and community, and assisting students as they pursue their academic and career goals. The center also plays a key role in campus outreach and recruitment through yield events and participation in programs involving California Community Colleges.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Transfer Student Center is a unit within The Centers for Educational Equity and Excellence, which strives to empower non-traditional, underserved, and underrepresented students with the support, expertise, and advocacy required to achieve at Berkeley and beyond.
