   The Process
  </strong>

  <span class="wiki-email" style="visibility: visible;">

  email link. The project coordinator checks the
  <span class="wiki-email" style="visibility: visible;">
   <a href="mailto:advising@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">
    advising@berkeley.edu
   </a>
  </span>
  email every morning and periodically through the day to review email messages and respond accordingly. Questions are answered via email and, if appropriate, students are referred to specific campus personnel, departments and/or web sites. If students request EOP verifications for the Berkeley Student Cooperative, RSF Scholarship, Berkeley Art Studio Scholarship, grad school prep fee reductions, etc., program coordinator accesses appropriate Google Doc and submits students name, SID, etc. so they may receive the particular accommodation/fee waiver/reduction. Follow-up email to students informs them that the EOP verification has been submitted (and provide them with appropriate instructions if necessary). All exchanges with UCB students, current and former, are to be documented in QUINCY.
