 <p>
  In order for a student to apply to be a PAC they must first apply for the iPAC internship program. The iPAC process takes place when needed based on the ebb and flow of current PACs, thus it is not annual.

  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  The iPAC program is headed by an iPAC lead (a current PAC whom applies to take this position). Students interested in being an iPAC should complete an application and are invited to interview. Applicants who are selected will complete a 5-week internship program that consists of PAC staff meetings, trainings and PAC shadowing. After the program, the iPACs apply to be a PAC and go through a final interview process. The number of available positions varies based on the current staff size of the PAC program.
