  The Dream Lending Library (DLL) provides textbook assistance to undocumented students on a first come first serve basis. Students may request up to 3 books per semester to help offset their financial expenses.

  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  The DLL is administered by an USP counselor who can check Quincy or MyFinAid to verify student's DREAM status. The application period is open 1 week before the start of the semester and closes at week 2 of semester. The application is a google form under the

  </span>
  account. It is sent to all students on email list.
 </p>
 <p>
  Students request which books they need (up to 3) and if we have them in stock, they are lent to students. If we do not have any of the 3 requested books, students get issued a credit at the Bookstore to purchase books ($100 max). After semester is over, students must return all materials purchased with funds or books that were lent to student. Students who do not return textbooks or misuse funds (i.e. rent books instead of purchase) are not allowed to participate for the following semester.
 </p>
 <p>
  At end of semester, students are emailed as a reminder to return books. Books are then added or checked in to the Current Book List and a DLL label is put inside of the book.
