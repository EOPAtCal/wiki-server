  EOP offers a graduate school prep course geared towards first-generation college students of all class standings (Frosh-Senior). The class is intended to help students explore the possibility of graduate school and provide them with the information needed to think about, apply to and be successful in graduate school and beyond.

  The goal of this course is to help students understand the process of thinking about, researching, applying to, and being successful in graduate school. Students will be able to explore their interests, begin writing their personal statements, and actively engage in the process of applying to schools while learning about and utilizing resources they have in their immediate surroundings to be successful in the process.
