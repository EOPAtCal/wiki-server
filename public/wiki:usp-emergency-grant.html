  Emergency Grants provide emergency funding for extenuating circumstances to undocumented students for up to $500. The housing emergency grant is intended for extenuating housing related costs whereas the general emergency grant is intended for extenuating food security, medical, dental, computer, and other unforeseen emergencies. Emergency grants do not have to be paid back and students apply through an on-line application. Students are awarded based on need and on a first come first serve basis. Students can only receive each emergency grant one time per academic year.
