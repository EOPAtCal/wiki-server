  The

   Berkeley Art Studio
  </a>
  has received an exciting new grant from the Chancellors Advisory Committee on Student Services and Fees (CACSSF). This means FREE art classes for UC Berkeley students who qualify for the Pell Grant or Dream Act Scholarship (until grant funds are exhausted). Administered in partnership with the Educational Opportunity Program, eligible students should visit the EOP office (119 Cesar Chavez, eop.berkeley.edu) to confirm eligibility for a free membership and receive a special registration code.

  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  When a student is interested in the Berkeley Art Studio Scholarship, EOP staff should verify Pell or Dream status. Once this is done, the student can be added to the
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkSvYNTnVXtgdGdJRVBzYjh3VHpQQ1BUa3NXQmRVRmc&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=3" target="_blank">
   "Berkeley Art Studio Scholarship" GoogleDoc
  </a>
  . There is no longer a registration code, the student will need to register for the art classes in person by visiting the Berkeley Art Studio. Please indicate whether the student will be taking a ceramics course or "other." Students may receive up to two scholarships per semester (or until funds are exhausted).
 </p>
 <p>
  Once a student receives a code, they can then sign up via the
  <a href="http://artstudio.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">
   Berkeley Art Studio
  </a>
  website with no charge. The
  <a href="http://artstudio.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">
   Berkeley Art Studio
  </a>
  will use the shared GoogleDoc to verify a student is eligible for the scholarship. If they are not (for example, if a non-eligible student learned the code from an eligible peer), the
  <a href="http://artstudio.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">
   Berkeley Art Studio
  </a>
  will charge the fee(s) to that student.
 </p>
 <p>
  If a student is eligible but has already paid for the course, EOP staff should still confirm eligibility and add the student to the GoogleDoc. At this point, the student should be directed to the
  <a href="http://artstudio.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">
   Berkeley Art Studio
  </a>
  so they can reverse charges.
