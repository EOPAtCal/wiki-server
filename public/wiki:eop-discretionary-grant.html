   EOP Carroll Grants
  </a>
  (formerly known as 'Discretionary Grants') are based on students' low-income status. Students must be Pell Grant or Dream Act Scholarship recipients as verified by the Financial Aid Office.
 </p>
 <p>
  Priority is given to students who have exhausted all of their subsidized loans. Students who submit grant requests and have remaining unused subsidized loan awards may only be eligible for 50% of the individual grant limits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Grants will be awarded for expenses incurred after June 1 of the academic year they are applying that fall into the following two areas:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Medical/Health:
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Medical/dental expenditures not covered by family or student health insurance.
  <br/>
  Eye glass expenditures not covered by family or student health insurance.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Graduate School Prep:
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Application expenses for graduate schools
  <br/>
  Prep Classes for graduate testing (Kaplan, etc.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Eligible students may be awarded up to $300 for each of these two areas. Students may submit separate applications for each area or submit both health and grad expenses in one application. Carroll Grants will be approved until all funds are exhausted.
 </p>

  with the supporting documentation, the information is forwarded to the Financial Aid Office for final approval. Carroll Grants will be credited to the Campus Accounts Receivable System (CARS). Any outstanding balance due to the university will be debited from the Carroll Grant award (i.e., library fines, locker fees, housing, etc). The remaining balance of the approved Carroll Grant will be disbursed to the student.
