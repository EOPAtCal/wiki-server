  One of of EOPs goals is to connect students to a network of support throughout campus. Because of this goal, we work to have strong relationships with all of the undergraduate academic advising units. Once a month, we convene a meeting with all of the directors of advising from the six schools and colleges to discuss issues related to improving the student experience. The six schools and colleges are:

  is shared with EOP and all schools and colleges advising directors. Members of the EOP College Partnerships team can add topics to discuss on a running list. Depending on the timeliness and priority of each issue, the EOP Academic Counselor who oversees College Partnerships will review the list and create an agenda for each meeting. The EOP Academic Counselor also facilitates the meeting, schedules these meetings on bCal (currently the third Wednesday of every month), finds a meeting location, and sends out meeting notes after each meeting.

 <p>
  As shown in the list above, projects between EOP and a specific college emerge from these meetings.
