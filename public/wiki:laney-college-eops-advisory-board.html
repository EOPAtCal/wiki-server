  populations, Alameda County public service programs, interested alumni, and others. At Laney College, the advisory board meets twice annually, once in mid-fall and again in mid-spring, to apprise members of the current status of the various programs and services offered by EOPS, numbers of students served, areas of concern, impending changes, budget matters, etc.

  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  As a member of Laney Colleges EOPS program advisory board, the EOP staff member will attend the bi-annual advisory board meetings and provide insights as to how UCBs EOP program can collaborate with Laneys EOPS program and best serve its students, a small number of whom are admitted to UC Berkeley each year. Additionally, EOP will get the names and contact with UCB admits to facilitate their transition to Berkeley.
