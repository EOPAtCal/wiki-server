   Contact Categories
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Contact categories describe the nature of a students visit and level of service provided by our office.
 </p>
 <p>
  (QUICK) QUESTION: Student has a simple question that does not require an appointment with a counselor. This may include asking for forms, inquiring about EOP status, a simple advising question (ex: when is the drop deadline?), etc. Staff selects RECEPTION on the sign-in computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT: Student has a previously scheduled appointment with a counselor. Staff selects that counselors name on sign-in computer.
 </p>
 <p>
  DROP-IN APPOINTMENT: When students visit our office to immediately see someone, they are referred to the DROP-IN counselor. Reception staff may also check to see if any other counselor is available by checking Bcal and calling a counselor who appears free. Staff selects the name of the desired available counselor. NOTE: DROP-IN counseling is available on a first come-first served basis. A student waiting for a DROP-IN APPOINTMENT who is not present when called to be seen by a counselor will be deleted from the waiting list on the NEW screen. If the student returns and still wishes to be seen they will have to be Signed-In once again.
 </p>
 <p>
  MAKE APPOINTMENT: Staff select this if a student is scheduling a future appointment with a counselor.
 </p>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  SIGN-IN: This describes the computer station and process of a student inputting information into that computer and database. Reception staff should be pro-active in engaging with students entering our reception office to ensure accuracy in the information being inputting into Quincy.

   Database categories
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  1) IDENTIFIERS  Include all individual counselor names. Reception staff identifies which staff member is to be seen in either a SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT or DROP-IN APPOINTMENT and selects that name in the SIGN-UP computer. Identifiers also include the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  A) RECEPTION  This identifier is selected when making a QUICK QUESTION or scheduling a future appointment.
  <br/>
  B) PEER ADVISORS  Selected when one of our Peer Academic Counselors answers a quick question/ and or completes an appointment with a student.
  <br/>
  C) NOT ASSIGNED  We will ask Richard to change this category to First Drop-In Available to signal when a student wanting a DROP-IN APPOINTMENT has no counselor preference.

 </p>
 <p>
  Step One: Student Walks In 119 Chavez
 </p>
 <p>
  Student is greeted by reception staff and asked about the nature of their visit. This exchange determines whether the student has a QUICK QUESTION, wants to MAKE an APPOINTMENT for a future date, is arriving for a SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT, or needs a DROP-IN APPOINTMENT. Upon identifying the appropriate level of service, the student is signed-in by reception staff.
 </p>
 <p>
  Step Two: Follow Up to A or B
 </p>
 <p>
  a) QUICK QUESTIONS or MAKE APPOINTMENT- Reception staff follows up by pulling student from the new list on QUINCY. On note screen, clicks on subject of question and/or types quick note. This is also an opportunity to correct information in students electronic file. Immediately sets end time, locks, and exits note page.
 </p>
 <p>
  b) DROP-IN APPOINTMENT or SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT  Counselor follows up by pulling student from the new list on QUINCY. Walks to into 119 Chavez to greet student and escort to individual office. Counselor may correct or input additional information on note or student summary page. At the end of the appointment, counselor selects topics discussed, types note, sets end time, checks spelling, locks and exits from note page. Or, if the counselor needs to move quickly to the next student waiting to be seen, they may simply exit the electronic comment/note screen and return to complete the entry by the end of the business day*. If a counselor is on drop-in, expecting a SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT, or will continue to be available to students, he/she will return to the new list to check for students waiting to be seen.
  <br/>
  *Entries not completed (including students assigned to a counselor and not yet pulled from the NEW list) within 48 hours of being created will be deleted.
