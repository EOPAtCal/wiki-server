  A course reader is a collection of student essays, readings, articles, and important resource information that is highly utilized through out the semester. Students will constantly reference the course reader to follow along with the class material and homework assignments.

  We have shifted away from using a physical copy of the course reader as we tranistion to bcourses, an online interactive course website that is utilized within school campus. However, you can preview a course reader from Fall 2015:
