  Most of the navigation of this program is done through a website called Quip, where we store all of our documents, templates, syllabi, agreements, surveys, meeting notes, and timelines. The web address is www.quip.com and if you're already logged in it is

  The first step in running SPMP is to schedule a meeting with all staff who will participate in facilitating the program. This meeting will be a place to discuss the structure of the course, who the presenters/campus partners will be, what resources to ask mentors to share with their mentees, reaffirming the syllabus for a new term, and so on. The purpose is to create the structure of the program for that semester.

  The Quip is being used as a storage center for files as well as a centralized place for communication. Along the left hand side, there is a section titled "Chat Rooms" where team communication takes place. There is also a section titled "Documents" under which the files are kept in folders divided by subject. These files and documents are what will primarily be used to create the semester plan for the course and program.
