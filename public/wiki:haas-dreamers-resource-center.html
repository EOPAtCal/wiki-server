Elises gift to the Undocumented Student Program recognizes her fathers longstanding success in championing equity and inclusion at UC Berkeley and celebrates the perseverance of Dreamers at Berkeley and beyond. The Haas Dreamers Resource Center is a community space where students have professional academic counseling support, peer support, opportunities to create learning communities, access to tools and resources such as computer stations and books, and a space to study between classes.
