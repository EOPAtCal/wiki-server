    GETTING STARTED WITH BCOURSES:
   </strong>
  </span>
 </h1>
 <p>
  <strong>
   STEP 0 - A note about access and permissions
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  To get access to bCourses, you will need a valid CalNet ID, and to create a course site, you will need to be the official instructor of record for a course. If you are a GSI for a course, you will not be able to create a site, unless its for the discussion section(s) that you are officially teaching.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   STEP 1 - Log into bCourses
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  URL:
  <a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">
   https://bcourses.berkeley.edu
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   STEP 2 - Create your site
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  See this bCourses help article for step-by-step instructions: Create your course site
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   STEP 3 - Add your course materials
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Adding your syllabus
  </strong>
  - You can upload an existing file or copy and paste your syllabus contents into the Syllabus tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Files
  </strong>
  - This is a repository for the files that you upload into bCourses. You can upload files directly here, or, you can upload them in other places in bCourses, such as anywhere there is an HTML editor, or in Modules. Please note: This tool has limited options for organizing content, and you cannot add links to external websites.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Modules
  </strong>
  - This is a tool where you can add not just files, but links to websites and other course content like Assignments (which include Assignments, Discussions, and Quizzes), Pages, etc. Any files that you upload into Modules also get automatically saved in Files. You can move content more freely and add virtually any type of content that you would like.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pages
  </strong>
  - You can use pages to add text, media, links to files, course content, and websites. Pages can also be used as wikis, a space that both students and instructors can edit and use for document collaboration. Canvas keeps the entire history of the page so you can see how it changes over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   STEP 4 - Add people
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Students - Course sites are tied to official registration information (by CCN), so students who have registered for the course will automatically get access- no need to add them manually. Enrollment information is updated every morning between 6-8a, after this window, they will get access upon the next update.
 </p>
 <p>
  Others - If would like to add unofficial TAs, class auditors, or other people into your course, they must have valid CalNet IDs.
 </p>
 <p>
  - For guests who do not have a CalNet ID, see this bCourses help article: Sponsor a CalNet Guest Collaboration Account
 </p>
 <p>
  - For those who already have valid CalNet IDs see this bCourses help article: Adding people to your site
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   STEP 5 - Publish your site
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that you have created your site, added your course materials and other people, the last thing to do is publish it so that it is available for students to access. See this bCourses help article on publishing your site (its really easy!): Publish your site
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   STEP 6 - Student View
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Want to see how your site looks to students before making it available to them? See this Canvas Guide: How do I access Student View?
