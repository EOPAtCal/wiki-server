   Description
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Students are notified with a confirmation of their EOP status via MyBerkeleyApp or with a direct email from our office once they are admitted. If a student was not identified as EOP but feels they meet the criteria, they may apply directly to our office to verify EOP status via the
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/berkeley.edu/forms/d/12xx8xgGXkyEh-vF0xI_SEKKxgNBjwgffBSZxm1va7pc/viewform" target="_blank">
   online EOP Application
  </a>
  . Individuals who meet ANY ONE of the three criteria listed below are considered EOP:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) Low Income (Pell Grant or Dream Act Scholarship recipients as verified by Financial Aid)
 </p>
 <p>
  2) First Generation College Students (Parent[s] have not graduated from a four-year college of university in the United States)
 </p>
 <p>
  3) Historically Underrepresented Students (African American, Chicano/Latino, Native American)
 </p>
 <p>
  **Please note that non-immigrant international students studying at Berkeley on student visas are not considered EOP.

  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  Student staff must first check the student into
  <a href="https://ce3-wiki.herokuapp.com/wiki:quincy">
   Quincy
  </a>
  before EOP verification process begins. Next, they will contact a counselor to verify the students EOP status. The counselor can use the following systems to verify:
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
   MyFinAid
  </span>
  : Students who receive the Pell Grant or Dream Act Scholarship qualify as low-income and EOP
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
   Myberkeley App
  </span>
  : Students coded as L4 by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions qualify as low-income and first-generation
 </p>
 <p>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
   DB2
  </span>
  : Students are coded by ethnic backgrounds in this system. By UC definition, historically underrepresented communities include African-American/Black, Chicano/Latino &amp; Native American.
 </p>
 <p>
  Checking Quincy and/or speaking to counselor should serve to verify EOP status in most cases. In those instances when status cannot be immediately verified and a student is not in Quincy and a counselor is not available, students can apply by using the

  <strong>
   It is the responsibility of the day's primary drop-in counselor to check the

    EOP application responses GoogleDoc
   </a>
   and process each open application.
  </strong>
  Upon processing the application, staff should input the student information into Quincy, create an "admin contact" in Quincy that describes that an EOP Application has been processed, and notify the student via email. Only low-income verified students are eligible for EOP financial resources such as the discretionary grant, Berkeley Art Studio Scholarship, and grad prep course fee reductions.
