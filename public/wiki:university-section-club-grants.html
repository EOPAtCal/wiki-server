  The S.O.S. (Services Offered Students) Committee and the Sylvia Elberg Memorial Fund is part of the University Section Club, Inc. To quickly respond to emergency needs of students, the University Section Club offers a grant to up to a maximum of $500, but may be less if the maximum is not needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  For larger grants (maximum $1,000) may be directed to the Chair of the Grants Committee. Grants from that committee go to students with a GPA of 3.5 or over. Students may not receive grants from more than one of the Section Clubs programs.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Section Club Grants are one of the various resources that are available to assist students. Because of it's limited amount of funding, Academic Counselors should explore other emergency and non-emergency resource options with students (EOP Disc Grant, FASO Emergency Loan, FASO Budget Appeal, Work-Study to Loan Conversion, EOP appeal for additional emergency loan, etc). In most causes, Academic Counselors should pursue a Section Club Grant only when these options have been exhausted, are not available, or only partially cover expenses resulting from extenuating circumstances.

  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  After meeting with a student, an Academic Counselor may determine that a student is eligible for a Section Club emergency grant or a GPA based larger award. Academic Counselors draft a letter to the Section Club that provides a description of the circumstances, how the case meets grant eligibility, and recommending the grant amount to be approved (within guidelines).
 </p>
 <p>
  When the request is funded, the student will be directly provided a hard-copy check (in most cases, via their counselor). Students should write a thank-you note to the University Section Club that confirms receipt of the award.
