  The objective of these meetings is to prepare for the planning of spring semester yield receptions for newly admitted transfer students from California Community Colleges. The counselor's role in ASY is to represent EOP at the California Yield events which are typically: San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange County and Berkeley. Planning consist of materials for tabling, budgeting travel cost (flights, hotel, car, meals), and trainings. YIELD events are important and essential to recruit as many newly admitted transfer students to UC Berkeley. Reaching out to students and proving information regarding their financial aid package, college and major, and housing options. ASYs goal is to make sure all questions transfer students may have about UC Berkeley are answered by the time they leave each event so they can make well informed decision be choosing to attend UC Berkeley. The EOP counselor informs them about the support services and resources we offer students once they arrive on campus.

  <strong>
   The Process
  </strong>
  <br/>
  At the outset, in the late fall, ASY meetings are held every two weeks. It then moves to a weekly meeting format in the spring. The working groups primary focus is outreach to newly admitted transfer students and the inclusion of its constituency in four primary programs:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) The Vice Chancellor of Equity and Inclusions reception for specifically targeted students (UREM, veterans, EOP, etc.)
  <br/>
  2) Fly to Berkeley Program for UREM
  <br/>
  3) Southern California Outreach Programs for UREM
  <br/>
  4) Inclusion of the above three groups in the Chancellors Reception/Resource Fair
 </p>
 <p>
  All four of the above programs take place in May. The ASY working group meets and develops the abovementioned programs. The EOP representative assists with various tasks associated with each of the programs and will be expected to accompany a smaller working group on the Southern California outreach which consists with three separate programs at community colleges during one week in the month of May. The EOP representative will coordinate EOPs larger effort with the Fly to Berkeley Program, a program where approximately 40 transfer students are flown to the CAL campus to partake in specific activities for them as well as participation in the Vice Chancellors and Chancellors receptions.
